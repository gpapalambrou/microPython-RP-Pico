## Fundamental Syntax and Operations

### Variables and Data Types
- Understanding integers, floats, strings, booleans.
- Variable assignment and naming conventions.

```python
temperature = 23.5  # Float
is_active = True    # Boolean
```

### Basic Operators
- Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %).
- Comparison (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
- Logical (and, or, not).

```python
if score >= 90 and grade == 'A':
    print("Excellent work!")
```

## Control Flow
### Conditional Statements
 - Using if, elif, and else to make decisions in code.
   
```python
if moisture_level < threshold:
    pump_water()
else:
    stop_pump()
```		
### Loops
- For Loops: Iterating over sequences or ranges.

```python
for i in range(5):
    blink_led()
```	
 - While Loops: Executing code as long as a condition is true.

```python
while not button_pressed:
    check_sensor()
```
